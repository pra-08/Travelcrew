    <h1>About US</h1>
       <div class="box">
            <img src="Images/logos/DP.jpg" alt="Founder">
            <p>I'm Aman Kumar, and I founded Travel Crew with one simple belief: that traveling isn't just about seeing new places, it's about experiencing them. My own adventures around the globe have shaped this belief, from the bustling markets of Marrakech to the tranquil temples of Kyoto. Each journey has left me with memories that have enriched my life in countless ways.            </p>
       </div>
       <div class="box">
            <p>Travel Crew is my way of sharing those experiences with you. It's about more than just booking flights and hotels; it's about crafting personalized journeys that resonate with your soul. Whether you're seeking an adrenaline-fueled adventure or a serene retreat, my team and I are here to make it happen.
                <br>
                I know firsthand the transformative power of travel. It opens your eyes to new cultures, challenges your perspectives, and connects you with people from all walks of life. That's why every itinerary we create at Travel Crew is designed to be more than just a vacationâ€”it's an opportunity for growth, exploration, and unforgettable moments.</p>
